Old and first project on OpenGL that was made for my programming subject in university. The task was to make a game where you need to guess constellation.

It was developed when I haven't knew OOP as well as now and only started to learn OpenGL, so as result - this code is bad. Here you can find basic and not so good abstraction on top of OpenGL to faster create buttons and objects on the screen. Also I've added music which you can change or turn off in settings.
